When the user open the app, he could login or register a new count in this welcome page. If the user click the “Register” button, a new LoginVC will pop up, as shown below.

If the user enter the email and password, and press the “Register” button, a new user object will be created in the backend. To get back to the login page, press “Cancel”. In the login page (image 1), the user could login by entering his email and password.

This is the "Contacts" page after the user logs in.

If the user selects “Friend Request” in the top left, then he could see a list of friend requests he received. If the user click the friend request cell, then a window will appear, and clicking “OK” would add the other user as friend. Now we go back to the “Contacts” page, we could see this new friend. If we open the “Friend Request” page again then the friend request list will be empty.
